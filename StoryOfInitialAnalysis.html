<div id="overview" class="section level1">
<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>Our quality control analyses showed that the 2hpf and 8hpf references with replicates removed produced datasets with statistically significant results. We extended our initial analyses by comparing these two datasets to each other.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-used" class="section level1">
<h1>Data Used</h1>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The significant genes list from the <a href="analysis2hpa2RR.html">2hpa Control - Two Replicates Removed</a> experiment.</li>
<li>The significant genes list from the <a href="analysis8hpa5RR.html">8hpa Control - Five Replicates Removed</a> experiment.</li>

<h1>Clustering Significant Genes</h1>
<div id="clustering-by-fold-change" class="section level3">
<h3>Clustering by Fold Change</h3>
<p>For the following heatmap, we hierarchically clustered the significant genes by log2 fold changes for each of the two experiments and for all developmental timepoints.</p>
<p>We highlight the first four time points (1hpf - 4hpf) with the 8hpf control and the second four timepoints (5hpf - 8hpf) with the 2hpf control. By doing this, we see an enrichment from 1hpf to 4hpf followed by a gradual decrease from 5hpf to 8hpf of a cohort of genes we are referring to as ‘Early Stage’. The ‘Late Stage’ cluster, in contrast, contains genes expressed at low levels from 1hpf to 4hpf that shift to increasingly higher levels of expression from 5hpf to 8hpf.</p>

<div id="clustering-by-rpkm" class="section level3">
<h3>Clustering by RPKM</h3>
<p>For the following heatmap, we hierarchically clustered the significant genes from the two experiments by z-score of the RPKM for all developmental timepoints. We see the same two clusters containing identical genes when clustering by this method.</p>
<p><img src="summary_figures/RPKMplotClusters-1.png" width="672" /></p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="significant-gene-pca" class="section level1">
<h1>Significant Gene PCA</h1>
<p>PCA analysis on the mean RPKM per sample for the significant genes in the heatmaps above was performed. We see that PC2 holds the variance that separates the ‘Early’ transcripts from the ‘Late’ transcripts. PC1 did not provide differentiation between the timepoints and may reflect technical variation.</p>

<h1>Cluster Trends</h1>
<p>Trends for each of the clusters in the heatmap ‘Clustering of the log2 Fold Changes of 2594 Genes’ are plotted below, with the 95% confidence interval on the error bars for both the mean z-score and the mean RPKM.</p>
