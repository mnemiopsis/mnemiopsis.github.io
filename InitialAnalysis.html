<div id="combined-control" class="section level2">
<h2>Combined Control</h2>
<p>For the following heatmaps I took the significant genes for the 2hpf and 8hpf control experiments and hierarchically clustered all of the timepoints for each reference control together.</p>
<p>In Heatmap A, I highlight the first four time points (1hpf - 4hpf) with the 8hpf control and the second four timepoints (5hpf - 8hpf) with the 2hpf control. In doing this we see the presence and then gradual decrease at 5hpf in the Cluster D genes, while all other clusters contain lowly expressed genes that shift to increasingly higher levels of expression at the 5hpf timepoint.</p>
<p>In Heatmap B I include all of the experimental timepoints for both controls, from which the clusters in Heatmap A were drawn.</p>

<div id="rpkm-clustering" class="section level1">
<h1>RPKM Clustering</h1>
<p>Cluster zscore of the mean RPKMs of significant genes using either the 8hr control or the 2hr control experiments</p>
<p>Heatmap C shows the RPKMs with the clusters derived from Heatmap B, while Heatmap D shows the clusters that are created from clustering purely from the zscore of the RPKM.</p>
<p>I think this is a pretty good proof a principle that the normalized RPKMs are able to recapitulate similar clusters to the differential expression data for the significant genes, with some minor differnces in the order of the genes. The two main clusters are present in both graphs.</p>

<div id="significant-gene-pca" class="section level1">
<h1>Significant Gene PCA</h1>
<p>Here I did a PCA analysis on the mean RPKM per sample for the significant genes in the heatmaps above. We see that PC2 holds the variance that separates the ‘early’ transcripts from the ‘late’ transcripts.</p>

<div id="identifying-housekeepers" class="section level1">
<h1>Identifying Housekeepers?</h1>
<p>Here I’m plotting the zscore of the RPKMs per gene. The red points are genes that have a log2 Fold Change in between 0.5 and -0.5 for all contrasts. I drew box plots over the points to get a better feel for the spread of the data and where the significant genes tended to fall in the quartiles.</p>
<p>Ariel brought up an interesting point about the genes that don’t change. What are the genes that don’t change and are there consitent ‘housekeepers’ that are present in all of the timepoints at a certain level? This plot tells me that there isn’t a definitive RPKM cutoff across the timepoints taht could help me define things that are highly expressed but not significant.</p>
